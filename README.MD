# Lens Protocol Subgraph on Near's Aurora Testnet

This is a subgraph for indexing Lens Protocols' contracts on Near's Aurora testnet.
As Lens Protocol does not officially support Aurora yet, their API and is naturally unavailable. 
Thus this subgraph was created to provide reliable indexing service for a personal app built along the same lines as Lens protocol. 

The code here would also be completely compatible with Lens protocol contracts even on the Polygon Mainnet where they are currently deployed.

Note: The contracts on Aurora were very recently deployed and hence have very few events so far, hence the low number of results being indexed by this subgraph.
